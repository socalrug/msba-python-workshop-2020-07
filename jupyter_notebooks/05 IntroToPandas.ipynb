    "## Module Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org) is an essential package for anyone doing data analysis in Python.  It provides fundamental data structures ([Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) and [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)) that make working with data much easier and more intuitive.  Pandas helps you to focus on the data analysis problems you're trying to solve, rather than the coding mechanics of how to solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pandas` package is deep and there's lots to learn (more than we can cover in this workshop!), but some of the main functionality it provides are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* functions for reading data into Python\n",
    "* data structures for storing, transforming and manipulating data\n",
    "* functions for subsetting data tables\n",
    "* functions for reshaping data\n",
    "* functions for performing grouped data operations\n",
    "* functions for making basic plots (using [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org) under the covers)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module of the workshop, we'll cover 4 main aspects of `pandas` which represent some of the most frequently encountered data analysis tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to working with tabular data (`DataFrames`) using `pandas`\n",
    "2. How to subset `DataFrames` to focus in on the data you want\n",
    "3. The basics of reshaping and combining data\n",
    "4. Basic data visualization using `pandas`"

    "### What is Tabular Data and Why is it Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabular data is simply a rectangular, 2-dimension table of data.  You've likely seen or worked with tabular data in many different contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Excel spreadsheets\n",
    "* Data you've collected or entered yourself (e.g. in a notebook, or spreadsheet)\n",
    "* In textbooks, presentations, journal articles\n",
    "* As column separate values (.csv) files\n",
    "* As a database table\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabular data is one of the most widely used ways of organizing data.  While not all data can be represented as a 2-dimensional table, lots (most?) data you'll typically encounter can be, or at least can be transformed into this structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `pandas` tabular data is stored in a format (a data structure) known as a `DataFrame`.  A `DataFrame` looks just like typical data table (image from pandas.pydata.org):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/_images/01_table_dataframe1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the image shows, a `DataFrame` is a rectangular table of data with rows and columns that intersect to give individual cells that store data values.  The rows and columns provide important structure: data along a given row or a given column are (typically) related in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, columns represent *variables* or specific attributes that are measured, while rows represent *observations* or the things that the measurements are being made on.  Consider the following data table:\n",
    "\n",
    "![]()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a hypothetical teacher is collecting information about their students: name, major, graduation year, and test scores.  Each of these individual types of data are represented as a **column** of the data table, and each **row** represents an individual student.  Imagine if you were to randomly scatter the data values across the cells of the table -- you'd still have the exact same data, but in a format that's completely useless to work with.  A well structured data table is an essential part of the data analysis process."
